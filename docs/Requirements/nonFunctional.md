### 5.2 Error Logging and Monitoring
- **Description**: The system should have real-time error logging and monitoring tools to track system health and detect issues.
- **Priority**: High
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Errors should be logged in real time, with alerts sent to system administrators when critical issues are detected.

### 5.3 Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
- **Description**: The software development process should incorporate CI/CD to ensure quick, reliable updates and bug fixes.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Acceptance Criteria**: New releases and patches should be deployed seamlessly without affecting system availability or user experience.

## 6. Backup and Disaster Recovery

### 6.1 Data Backup
- **Description**: The system should automatically back up user data daily, ensuring data is retrievable in the event of system failure or disaster.
- **Priority**: High
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Daily backups should be maintained, with data recoverable within 4 hours of a system failure.
